# Discussion-Board
A discussion board application using the MEAN stack

To run the application locally:

1) Make sure you have Node.js and Mongodb installed.

2) Navigate to the project directory.

3) Start an instance of mongodb using the "mongod" command.

4) Start the server using the command "node server.js"

5) Go to localhost:8000 and interact with the application.


P.S. The design is a work in progress, but the back-end logic is sound and fully functional.
